# Krypt - Web 3.0 Blockchain Application (In Typescript)
![Krypt](https://i.ibb.co/DVF4tNW/image.png)

### Purpose
This is a repository based on and inspired by JavaScript Mastery's video tutorial. View that video [here](https://nextjs.org/).

I have implemented the code in TypeScript instead of JavaScript because TypeScript is awesome...

Using Web 3.0 methodologies, Solidity and Metamask you'll learn how to build a your first real Web 3.0 Application - from start to finish.
